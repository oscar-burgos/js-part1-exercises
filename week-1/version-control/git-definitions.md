# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

**Saving different stages of a project along the way. It is useful because you can always go back to a previous version if something is not working properly.**


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

**A branch is a copy of the project. It is important because it allows you to work on the project while keeping a copy of the original code in case your changes don't work or end up being unused**

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

**A commit is code that is good enough to be included in the final project. A good commit message is brief yet specific**

* What is a merge conflict?


**A merge conflict is when there are competing changes to the same line of code**
